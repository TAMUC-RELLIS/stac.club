# What is a CTF?
A CTF, or a Capture The Flag, is a friendly competition with a collection of cyber security challenges that can be presented in many different ways. The aim of a CTF is to challenge its contestants and help them improve their skills in cyber security. The CTF that we are holding is a jeapordy style CTF meant to be for all skill levels, so if you are a beginner don't be shy to participate!
