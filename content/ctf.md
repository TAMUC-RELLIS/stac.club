<center><h1 style="font-size: 25px"> What is a CTF? </h1></center>

A CTF, or a Capture The Flag, is a friendly competition with a collection of cyber security challenges. Flags are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors try to steal flags either from the organizers (jeopardy-style CTFs) or from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs). The CTF that we are holding is a jeapordy style CTF meant to be for all skill levels, so if you are a beginner donâ€™t be shy to participate!

 The aim of a CTF is to challenge its contestants and to help them improve their skills in cyber security. For more information on what CTFs are, <a style="color: #07a500;" href="https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/">Click here.</a>

<a style="color: #07a500;" href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a> is a great resource if you want to get started on CTFs!
The picoGym is designed to prepare you with some basic but necessary skills.
