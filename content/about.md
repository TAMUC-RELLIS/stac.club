# We are The Science Technology And Computing Club at RELLIS!
{{< image src="/images/green_on_darkergrey.png" alt="stacc logo" position="center">}}

We are focused on creating a place for students to collaborate and improve in whatever field they want to pursue in the industry. From resume workshops, guest speakers, and even mock interviews, we aim to provide a diverse array of meetings and resources to achieve this goal. 

STACC meetings are held at the TAMUS RELLIS campus, but we welcome students from **everywhere**!

# Meetings *every Wednesday* at 4:15 PM at the RELLIS Academic Complex Building #2, Room #314.
